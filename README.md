# Hi, I'm Mia ðŸ‘‹

About Me!:
Growing up, my family called me Curious George. Iâ€™ve always been full of questions and ideas, constantly looking for ways to improve the world around me. As a Computer Science major with skills in Python, machine learning, and data structures, I channel that curiosity into building meaningful, tech-driven solutions.

I'm especially passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, particularly those in the entertainment industry, where creativity meets technology. This summer, I completed an immersive AI/ML fellowship where I trained models to predict customer churn, analyze sentiment, and more. It deepened my technical skills and showed me the impact thoughtful model-building can have.

Coding Languages: Python, C++
Data Analysis/ Machine Learning: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn

Project I've worked on!:
Airbnb Review Rating Prediction
- Built and evaluated a Random Forest model to predict Airbnb review scores (1-5) using listing data
Conducted feature engineering, handled missing data, and applied one-hot encoding to improve model performance
