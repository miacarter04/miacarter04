# Welcome, I'm Mia! 👋

**🎓 Junior at Long Beach State, studying Computer Science**

**👩‍💻 About Me**

Ever since I was little, my family has called me "Curious George", always excitedly asking questions and looking for ways to improve the world around me. As a Computer Science major with skills in Python, machine learning, and data structures, I channel that curiosity into building meaningful, tech-driven solutions.  
I'm especially passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, particularly those in the entertainment industry, where creativity meets technology. This summer, I completed an immersive AI/ML fellowship where I trained models to predict customer churn, analyze sentiment, and more. It deepened my technical skills and showed me the impact thoughtful model-building can have.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

**Coding Languages:** Python, C++  
**Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
**Tools:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks

**📊 Featured Project: Airbnb Review Rating Prediction**
- Built and evaluated a Random Forest model to predict Airbnb review scores (1-5) using listing data
- Conducted feature engineering, handled missing data, and applied one-hot encoding to improve model performance
